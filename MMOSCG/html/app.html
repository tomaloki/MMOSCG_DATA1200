        <h1>Our vision in an App</h1>
        <p>
            With our app, PILI (Play it, Learn it) we want to create a platform where children can meet, play and learn. We want to ensure that the Syrian children in crisis areas have the possibility to continue learning, and at the same time have connection with other children and teachers. PILI will lay a foundation for a learning environment that is fun and easy to access. Since the target group is children aged 6-18 years, the app will offer different difficulties based on which level/class you are on.
            </p>
      <!--  <h1>Why is PILI an ideal app for further learning?</h1> -->
        <br>
        <p>Our app is ideal for its use because it enhances the connection between learning and fun.
            The association between the words “learning” and “fun” needs to be stronger, and PILI will contribute in that.
            The app also provides in creating a community between children and teachers, where they can cooperate and
            learn together. Working and learning together with other children amplifies both motivation and
            inspiration, which will help the children in further advancing their skills as they get older.

                    The quizzes will be an extra platform inside the app where you
                    can challenge and test yourself. This will
                    be an alternative to the adventure game, where you can browse through hundreds of
                    quizzes and challenge yourself
                    even further. All of the quizzes will be divided into different categories and difficulties.

                The forum is a place where you can connect with other students and teachers wherever you are, so that you
                can discuss, get help or just share information about which level you are on in your adventure game. We want
                to make this a safe place for all the students, where they feel that they can hang-out with each-other even
                though they are not in the same room, building or village even. There will also be a possibility to chat and
                connect with teachers, who will be available in certain timeslots.

                    In short terms, the app will offer three different stations; an adventure game,
                    a forum and a quiz-page. The adventure game can be compared to other similar games,
                    such as Candy Crush, where you can climb and reach different levels. The levels will consist
                    of small games and task which you must solve and get through to be able to reach the next level.
                    For every 5th level there will be a video that you have to watch to be able to pass through
                    the next levels.
                    The videos will be short and informational, where you learn information about different subjects,
                    such as math,
                    geography, history etc. The higher level, the harder difficulty!
